My Event Venue is a modern, feature-rich Android application built to streamline event creation, discovery, and ticketing for both organizers (admins) and attendees (users).

Users can discover nearby events using Mapbox Place AutoComplete, filter by category, location, or event name, and book free or paid tickets via Razorpay. Booked events appear under "Upcoming" or "Past" sections, and users receive instant confirmation notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging.
Admins have a powerful dashboard to create events, manage them, and view real-time statistics including total revenue, sales, and ticket counts. Each event supports image uploads, live registration tracking, and even refund handling for paid events.
With secure Google & Email authentication, responsive Jetpack Compose UI, and offline capabilities via SharedPreferences, My Event Venue is a complete Firebase-powered solution for modern event management.
